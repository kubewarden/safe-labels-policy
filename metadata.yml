  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy validates the labels of generic Kubernetes objects.

    The policy rejects all the resources that use one or more labels on the deny list. The deny list is provided by at runtime via the policy configuration.

    The policy allows users to put constraints on specific labels. The constraints are expressed as regular expression and are provided via the policy settings.

    The policy settings look like that:
    ```yaml
    # List of labels that cannot be used
    denied_labels:
    - foo
    - bar

    # Labels that are validate with user-defined RegExp
    # Failing to comply with the RegExp resuls in the object
    # being rejected
    constrained_labels:
      priority: "[123]"
      cost-center: "^cc-\\d+$"
    ```

    **Note well:** the regular expression must be espressed using Go's syntax.
